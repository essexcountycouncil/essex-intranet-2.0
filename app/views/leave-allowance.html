      <p>
      How much annual leave you get is written in your contract.
      <br>It depends on:
      </p>
      <ul class="">
        <li>conditions of service</li>
        <li>salary</li>
        <li>length of service.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Due to the various different types of contracts within the organisation, you can check your annual leave entitlement in our <a href="public//images/Holiday_policy.pdf" target="_blank">Holiday Policy (PDF, 165KB)</a> or check your contract.</p>
